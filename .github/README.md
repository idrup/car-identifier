# Car Identifier Website

A simple website that allows the users to post a picture of a car and get back information about the car such as make and model and basic information.

I created this as I like looking at cars and different models and makes and researching about it and to make it easier for me to identify new cars that I have previously never seen.

The website using OpenAI API to get the image from the submited image URL as OpenAI is currently not able to read raw images from file uploads. The website will then ask the request the OpenAI to identify the make, model, year and details of the car which will then be extracted and neatly presented on the website.
